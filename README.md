It has been designed and runs on Unix systems.
The main binaries that can be built from source (CPP) are :
- An interpreter (executable)
- A shared library (with Python and Java bindings)

## 1. Building from source

ForeFire can be built from source by running `install-forefire.sh`

```
cd forefire

sudo bash install-forefire.sh
```

You can inspect this installer script to understand the linux dependencies and build commands

The program will be built in: `./bin/forefire`

The installer will ask if you wish to make `forefire` command available on the shell, by adding `export PATH="</path/to/bin>:$PATH"` at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file. Alternatively the file can also be manually edited with  `nano ~/.bashrc`

## 2. Running an example

Examples are provided on the `tests` folder. You can inspect `tests/runff/run.bash` to check usage

## 3. Running with python
Go and check [./bindings/python/README.md](./bindings/python/README.md)

## 4. Building with Docker
A sample Dockerfile can allow to build a Docker image with
```
docker build . -t forefire
```

To run this image and interactively acces the continer use
```
docker run -it forefire bash
```
