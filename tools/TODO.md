Things to do
- use of ERA 40 to reanalyse any wildfire using FF/MNH
- A simple python case to put weather files into a FF simulation
- same python script by FF script
- include all Firecaster FF models into wildfire ROS library
- generate a fuel file with different water stress
- a nice code generator from python to FF
- a list of examples and coupled test cases directly in ForeFire
- numerical unit test for FF in 2D : circles, area round, ellipses, mass conservation for heat fluxes
- numerical tests for fuel models in 2D.. slopes, wind. Best would be 1 model 10 slopes for same wind.
- stuff to make ff from shapefiles
- stuff to make ATmap from fffiles
- stuf to get stats from ATmap
- get the FWI from mars
- perform a reanalysis on several wildfires in europe, calibrate adjustment speeds with it
- MesoNH Sandbox
